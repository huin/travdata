== Building with tabula-rs

To build a working version of tabula-java for use with tabula-rs, use `mask
build-tabula-rs`, or look at the script in `maskfile.md`.

The entry point into Tabula Java opens the PDF document each time, which is
probably computationally expensive. Unsure if that's addressable without
patching Tabula further.
