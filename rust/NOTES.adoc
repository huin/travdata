== Building with tabula-rs

To build a working version of tabula-java for use with tabula-rs:

[source,shell]
----
# with maven installed: (e.g. nix-shell -p maven)
mkdir deps
cd deps
git clone git@github.com:sp1ritCS/tabula-rs.git
git clone git@github.com:tabulapdf/tabula-java.git
cd tabula-java
patch -p1 < ../tabula-rs/0001-add-ffi-constructor-to-CommandLineApp.patch
mvn compile assembly:single
----

This will produce the required 
`deps/tabula-java/target/tabula-1.0.6-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar`.

The entry point into Tabula Java opens the PDF document each time, which is
probably computationally expensive. Unsure if that's addressable without
patching Tabula further.

== Adding ZIP file support

When ZIP files are to be read, we might be able to make do with no extra features:

[source,toml]
----
[dependencies.zip]
version = "1.2.1"
# We don't need many features - we write our own ZIP files without encryption
# and compression etc., so strip this down to a minimum.
default-features = false
